<h3>Luka first played for Slovenia and got drafted to the league when he was 17. I consider him to be The <abbr title= "Greatest of All Time"> GOAT</abbr></h3>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don%C4%8Di%C4%87"> Check out Luka's biography! </a>
<p><em>Luka Doncic</em> will become the most talked about player in the years to come. He plays for the Dallas Mavericks as a point guard. Him and Kristaps Porzingis were supposed to take a championship, but KP recently got traded to the Nets.
This is actually benefical for <b>Luka Doncic </b> as Kristaps was starting to become inefficient and downright "soft".</p>
<p>The main point of this website is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show you that Luka Doncic is better than Kobe Bryant</li>
<li>Show you that Luka Doncic is better than Michael Jordan</li>
<li>Show you that Luka Doncic is better than Lebron James</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, I am going to add the following two numbers and display the result, Luka's jersey number</p>
<p>First number:<span id= "firstNum">70</span> <br></p>
<p>Second number: <span id= "secondNum">7</span> </p>
<p>Therefore, the sum of the two of those numbers is: <span id=
"answer">(placeholder for the answer)</span></p>
<input type="button" id="sumButton" value="Click to add!">

<script>
function displaySum() {
let firstNum = Number(document.getElementById('firstNum').innerHTML)
let secondNum = Number(document.getElementById('secondNum').innerHTML)
let total = firstNum + secondNum;
document.getElementById("answer").innerHTML = ` ${firstNum} + ${secondNum}, equals to
${total}` ;
}
document.getElementById('sumButton').addEventListener("click", displaySum);
